                    Wonka Chocolate Factory was founded by Willy Wonka, between the 1920's and 1930's. Eventually, Wonka's amazing invention such as chocolate ice cream that never melts and bluebird's eggs that grow baby bluebirds sold so well that his factory grew 50 times as big as any other.

                    Mr. Wonka realized he was becoming elderly and he needed an heir to his factory. He decided against grown-up because a grown-up would not listen. He decided to open his factory to a small few amount of children of whom he would test to see who was the most well-behaved. He sent out five Golden Tickets hidden inside Wonka Bars all around the world. These Golden Tickets allowed entry into the factory. Five children found the Golden Tickets: Augustus Gloop, a greedy candy consumer; Veruca Salt, a spoiled brat; Violet Beauregarde, a bratty gum-chewer; Mike Teavee, a cowboy wannabe obsessed with television; and Charlie Bucket,a well-behaved and humble poor boy who loved chocolate. After the Tickets were found, Wonka allowed them entry into the factory. Throughout the tour, Augustus, Veruca, Violet, and Mike were put in harm's way when they did whatever they wanted and ended up having to leave the factory due to their horrible behavior. Charlie, due to his good behavior, won the factory.
                    
                    Charlie decided to open the factory up to visitors in memory of Mr.Wonka and his magical chocolate factory.
